# Visualizing Cultural Collections
#### PhD position

## Background

Visualization can be a powerful way of making available cultural collections to broad audiences, 
and it can encourage new and inspiring perspectives as part of casual exploration and research 
(see [1,2,3] for examples). However, current visualization approaches in this context also have 
limitations. Print-based cultural collections are often unique in their material and visual aesthetics 
(e.g., size, paper texture, fonts, images and illustrations, and marginalia), and visualizing just their 
textual content cannot do them justice [4]. In fact, the material characteristics of cultural collections 
can provide important details on their history, inherent production processes, intended audiences, and how 
items were handled and shared – all important aspects to consider as part of humanities research. 
Reading has been recognized as an inherently embodied experience and, therefore, representing material 
qualities is also important for casual readers.

## Goal

This PhD project will focus on the question of how to systematically expand visualization as a method of 
representing abstract data to allow for the integration of material and visual characteristics of cultural 
collections. This research can take several directions. For example, data physicalization may be applied as a 
way to explore the unique characteristics of a cultural collection through different modalities. Another avenue 
could explore how to combine visualization design with computational approaches, such as computer vision and 
machine learning to enable the rapid classifications of material and aesthetic characteristics.

## Supervisory Team
The main supervisor on this project will be [Dr Uta Hinrichs](http://www.utahinrichs.de) who is an expert in 
data visualization and human computer interaction. Her research specifically focuses on research methods at 
the intersection of visualization and (digital) humanities. 

Since this is an interdisciplinary research project, additional 
supervisor(s) from the humanities will be invited to join the supervisory team once a PhD candidate is selected.

## Qualifications
- Bachelor’s or master's degree in CS, Design, Digital Humanities or Visual Arts & Design. An interdisciplinary background is not essential but desirable.
- Experience in visualization, visual design, and/or interface design
- Experience in conducting qualitative research, e.g., interviews, observational studies, etc...
- Strong interest in interdisciplinary research 
- Computer programming skills are desirable, in particular, developing web-based visualizations and interfaces 

## How to Apply
The start date of this position is flexible. If you are are interested in this position and would like to get more information about the project and funding opportunities, please get in touch with Dr Uta Hinrichs via email: [uhinrich[at]edi.ac.uk](mailto:uhinrich@ed.ac.uk).
