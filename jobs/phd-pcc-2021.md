# PhD in Data Visualization and Visual Communication for Peadiatric Care

## Background

Peadiatric critical care (PCC) is a highly valued specialist service that saves infants’ and
children’s lives. However, having a child needing critical care is a stressful event for parents
because their child suddenly requires different technologies within peadiatric intensive care
units (PICU) to survive. This often results in persistent post-traumatic stress syndrome in
parents even after the child has recovered from critical illness [1].

One common reason PICU is such a stressful environment for parents is because PCC
patients follow complex pathways, from the moment they are admitted to the PICU to the time
that they are discharged. These pathways are different for each patient and depending on their
severity of illness, they may require different levels of organ support. Parents find it
particularly hard to make sense of and navigate these complex pathways, causing them stress
and anxiety.

Regardless of the level of organ support a PCC patient requires, the technologies
used in PICU routinely generate large volumes of data (e.g. bedside physiological data
including heart rate, blood pressure, mechanical ventilator data, etc.) which inform the design
of personalized care pathways. However, communicating this complex specialist information in
a meaningful way to parents without using medical jargons is particularly hard in the
traditional verbal consultation method. Some clinicians will attempt to draw simplified
diagrams to explain but this is dependent on the clinicians’ ability to draw and communicate
via their rudimentary drawings.

## Goal

In this proposal, we aim to apply data comics and other techniques from data
visualization and data-driven storytelling to provide for an effective communication
between clinicians and parents. Data comics is a way of communicating data and data
visualizations, pioneered by Bach (2), [https://datacomics.github.io](https://datacomics.github.io). Data comics combine
methods from data visualization and data literacy [3], and they have been found an effective Aims
To support clinician-parent communication, our aims with this proposal are as follows:

1. Identify personalized PCC pathways and associated health indicators through the
analysis of clinical and physiological data.
2. Develop novel visualizations of personalized PCC pathways for a non-expert
audience, which capture key information about the patient’s status and describe
the next steps in their care. This will involve user-centered design methods such
as interviews and focus groups. Our prototypes will be functional softwareapplications that generate comics, flapbooks, etc.
3. Evaluate the usefulness of the visualizations, in terms of support for doctorparent communication and parents’ understanding of PCC plan for their child.
This will also involve user-centered design methods and it will include the
participation of clinicians and parents.
Improved communication and understanding of their child’s condition and progress on
PICU may ultimately help to reduce parental anxiety and emotional distress. This is an
important outcome in modern family-orientated PCC delivery.
