![atlases-examples](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68b8f0a5-e255-4787-bf4d-aa8616185025)


The UK Co-Benefits Atlas project—run by researchers from Design Informatics, the School of Informatics, the University of St. Andrews and the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute—is seeking a research associate (grade 7) for around 25-30% FTE between now and July 2025. 

The project envisions facilitation and co-design of an interactive web-based data interface, the UK Co-benefits Atlas, to visualise emission reduction co-benefits on, e.g., health, energy bills and other measures, across the entire UK [1]. Inspired by our previous analysis of visualization atlases [2], this project will co-design and deploy a first version of the atlas, informed by extensive engagement with future atlas stakeholders such as the Scottish Research Alliance for Energy Homes and Livelihoods, PWC Sustainability, and Department of Energy Security and Net Zero. By the open data and analyses published through our atlas, we aim to inform decision making by:
- businesses seeking commercial net zero opportunities.
- communities and policy makers with net zero mandates.
- researchers and analysts examining the socio-economic co-benefits of net zero interventions. 

The successful candidate will be embedded within the VisHub research group (vishub.net, Benjamin Bach) at Informatics and EFI as well as the ECCI (Andrew Sudmant) and closely work with all of the staff on the project (see below).

## Job Description
	
The main task of the job is to coordinate and run the stakeholder engagement with potential Atlas stakeholders partner institutions and to lead the co-design focus groups. The goal is to create a rich picture for the needs for communicating co-benefits data and then devise respective visualisation and user interface designs for the atlas.

### Tasks and responsibilities
- Organise co-creation focus groups with industry and public sector stakeholders
- Conduct interviews with stakeholders
- Perform qualitative data analysis on interview and focus group results 
- Plan and run usability evaluations with partners
- Help design graphical atlas interface, interactions, and visualisations 

### Required expertise
- Strong interest in co-benefits and data analysis 
- Interview and questionnaire design
- Qualitative data analysis 
- Workshop organisation, facilitation and qualitative data collection 
- Visualization / UI design / graphics design

### Bonus expertise
- Experience with stakeholder engagement 
- Good writing and communication skills 
- Advanced visualisation design and programming
- Web development 

Some flexibility around scheduling can be negotiated as long as commitment averages 25-30% FTE over the project period.

The successful candidate needs to  
- have the right to work in the UK for the entire duration of the project
- be physically working from the UK during the project
- Spend most of their time in Edinburgh and St. Andrews for workshops


## Application 

Send an email to bbach@ed.ac.uk & andrew.sudmant@ed.ac.uk including 
- CV
- Short motivation statement detailing 
  - Why you are interested in this project
  - How you expertise responds to the call

The position will be filled as soon as a suitable candidate is found. 


## Project Background

Current research from the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute (ECCI), using a model developed for the UK Climate Change Committee (CCC), finds that for every 1£ spent on climate change mitigation in the UK there are as much as 14£ of social benefits in the form of improved public health, better urban connectivity, and increased productivity. Here, we ask the question, How can we communicate these findings to inform and accelerate climate action?

To address this question, this project we will co-create an interactive web-based data interface—the UK Co-Benefits Atlas (UKCBA). UKCBA will make co-benefits data and analyses more accessible, understandable, and useful for businesses, investors, researchers, third sector organisations and policymakers across Scotland and the wider UK. Compared to traditional static reports and research papers, visualization atlases are a novel and comprehensive means that provide interactive visualisations, in-depth analyses, and contextual explanations to explore data in a structured and accessible way; for examples, see [https://vis-atlas.github.io](https://vis-atlas.github.io). 

The ECCI modelling team, which is part of our project core-team (Dr. Andrew Sudmant), provides 17 co-benefits for >1000 possible climate interventions in 57,000 UK 'datazones' (lower-layer super output areas,  LSOAs) across the UK. Funding the UKCBA will enable us to co-create an interactive visualization atlas with its future users and stakeholders; for this project we already have strong commitment from 9 Scottish partners across academia, business, and the public sector (see below), stating the need of such an atlas and which are highly invested in supporting the project through attending workshops and helping with its co-design. The result will be a collaboratively created, cutting-edge, and first-of-its-kind platform capable of facilitating interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral collaborations and decision making between diverse stakeholders around the complex socio-economic benefits of climate interventions.

Andrew's research focuses on quantifying and mapping the co-benefits of climate action in the UK. His work at the Edinburgh Climate Change Institute and with other collaborators has led to the development of models that estimate social, economic, and environmental benefits from climate interventions. One notable finding from his latest research shows that for every £1 spent on climate mitigation, up to £14 in social benefits are realized, particularly in areas like public health and urban connectivity.
