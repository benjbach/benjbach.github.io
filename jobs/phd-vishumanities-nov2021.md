# Re-thinking Visualization as Part of Humanities Research 
#### PhD position

## Background

Digitization has enabled humanities researchers to make use of computational methods for 
analyzing and interpreting document collections at a large scale. It is widely acknowledged 
by now that visualization has a role to play in these endeavors. However, more critical voices 
highlight that visualization, as a method predominantly designed by and for the sciences, may be 
at odds with humanities research approaches that focus on qualitative methodologies where knowledge is 
considered as situated and constructed [1]. How can visualization complement methodologies that are grounded in 
qualitative research and theory? Previous research has highlighted the potential of visualization to act as a 
mediator between disciplines [2] in that it can be considered as visual manifestation of certain 
perspectives which, in turn, can facilitate discussions between researchers from different disciplines. 
This perspective parts from the notion of visualization as a tool that can output clear answers. 
Instead, it embraces the idea of visualization as a dynamic process that provokes reflection, 
encourages discussion and that can mediate between disciplines by making visible different points of views. 

## Goal

This PhD project will expand investigate in-depth the role of visualization in humanities research 
with the goal inform new ways of thinking about visualization as a method and research in the digital 
humanities. A potential starting point could be a set of qualitative studies to explore how existing 
visualization tools are currently being used as part of humanities research (e.g., with a particular 
focus on literary studies) to identify current practices and potential for innovation. This could 
be followed by design explorations and prototyping that will investigate how to complement 
traditional practices in humanities research through visualization. 

## Supervisory Team
The main supervisor on this project will be [Dr Uta Hinrichs](http://www.utahinrichs.de) who is an expert in 
data visualization and human computer interaction. Her research specifically focuses on research methods at 
the intersection of visualization and (digital) humanities. 

Since this is an interdisciplinary research project, additional 
supervisor(s) from the humanities will be invited to join the supervisory team once a PhD candidate is selected.

## Qualifications
- Bachelor’s or master's degree in CS, Design, or Digital Humanities. An interdisciplinary background is not essential but desirable.
- Experience in visualization, visual design, and/or interface design
- Experience in conducting qualitative research, e.g., interviews, observational studies, etc...
- Computer programming skills are highly desirable, in particular, developing web-based visualizations and interfaces 
- Strong interest in interdisciplinary research   

## How to Apply
The start date of this position is flexible. If you are are interested in this position and would like to get more information about the project and funding opportunities, please get in touch with Dr Uta Hinrichs via email: [uhinrich[at]edi.ac.uk](mailto:uhinrich@ed.ac.uk).
