**Problem:** Political decision makers, organizations, advisors, and researchers rely on data about peace and conflicts. These data can include peace agreement documents, violence and riots, political indicators, environmental factors, demographics, etc. In order to support these decisions, data from many different resources (social media, data bases, sensors, surveys, ...) need to be combined, aggregated, analyzed, and visualized. 

**Approach:** This project investigates ways for visualizing peace and conflict data for analysis and participation. Participation referring to feedback channels (e.g., through annotations and comments) for the audience of these visualizations, a crucial point to provide scrutiny, transparency, and enrich data through personal accounts.  

**Skillset:** D3/Webdevelopment, visualization design, data science, data bases
