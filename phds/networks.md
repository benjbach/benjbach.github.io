# Visualizing Spatio and Temporal Multivariate Networks
![](https://vishub.net/figures/vistorian.png)

**Problem:** Relational data (e.g., networks) are used to represent many data sets and real-world phenomena such as social networks, food-webs, functional and structural brain networks, trade relationships, and many more. However, many of these networks do have additional data attached to the, such as geography (e.g., trading networks), or time (e.g., functional brain connectivity, social networks). How can this complexity be visualized to allow for both effective interactive exploration and engaging communication? 

**Approach:** This project will design new visualization techniques for geographic and temporal networks across a range of domains. We will engage in co-design sessions, workshops, prototyping, system-building, longitudinal projects, software architecture and a range of human-centered evaluation techniques.
