# Visualization Literacy and Education 

**Problem:** Visualization literacy is the ability to read, design, create, apply, and critique data visualizations for various tasks. Empowering people in these abilities requires teaching methods and material that goes beyond the traditional classroom environment but that includes informal learning: self-led learning that happens on different paces, at home/work, by working professionals, and alongside the process of using or designing visualizations in people's daily work. How can these non-traditional scenarios be supported? 

**Approach:** This project will survey, explore, develop, and evaluate, methods and digital tools to supporter learning visualization literacy beyond the classroom. 

**Skillset:** D3/webdevelopment, visualization design, data science.
