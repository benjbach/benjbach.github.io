The VisHub is running a visualization course for working professionals. This is a 10-week long online course build around lectures, live tutorials, talks, Q&A sessions, individual check-in sessions with the course organizers, and project work. Each participant can join with their own data set and develop their own visualization project along the structured guidance and feedback along the 10 weeks. The course ends with a certificate.

For more details, see the [course website](https://datavis-online.github.io/).

The course allows us to better understand how visualizations is used and valued in application and which challenges and expectations people using visualization methods and tools see in their work and engagement with visualization.
