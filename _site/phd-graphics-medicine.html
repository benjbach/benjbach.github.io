<h1 id="phd-in-visualising-complex-care-pathways-in-later-life">PhD in Visualising Complex Care Pathways in Later Life</h1>

<h2 id="project-summary">Project Summary</h2>

<p>Health care in later life is complex and hard to navigate. We aim to apply <strong>a combination of data visualisation, illustration, natural language processing, and process modelling</strong> to medical guidelines and patient care data, so as to visualise care pathways that are personalised to individual patients and easy to understand. Our ambition is that these interactive visualisations can help people in later life gain a deeper understanding of their trajectories of care, as well as enable discussions with specialists and family members around adapting care to their wishes, priorities and needs.</p>

<h2 id="aim">Aim</h2>

<p>To visualise personalised care pathways to individuals in later life to help understand, explore, and discuss with doctors and family members.</p>

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Develop innovative methods for depicting, visualising, and discovering complex care pathways in later life, drawing on process modelling and interactive data visualisation.</li>
  <li>Employ Natural Language Processing methods to extract key information regarding care pathways from medical guidelines and other data, e.g., electronic health records.</li>
  <li>Investigate the needs of people in later life with respect to visualising and communicating complex care pathways.</li>
  <li>Evaluate how our novel visualisation approach can support understanding, exploration, and discussion by working closely with people in later life.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="supervisor-team">Supervisor Team</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://benjbach.me">Dr. Benjamin Bach</a> is a Lecturer in Design Informatics and Visualization at the School of Informatics and the Institute of Design Informatics.

</ul>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>This PhD is funded by the <a href="http://www.edin.care">Advanced Care Research Center (ACRC)</a> at the Usher Institite, Edinburgh. All applications will go through ACRC but we strongly encourage to <a href="mailto:bbach@inf.ed.ac.uk">get in touch with the supervisor team</a> before applying. The ACRC runs a 1+3 program, which means that</p>
<ul>
  <li>the first year is typically dedicated to taught courses and preparing the PhD research proposal</li>
  <li>the last 3 years are dedicated to the actual PhD research.</li>
</ul>

<p>While all of the research for this project will be done at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics">School of Informatics</a> and the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher">Usher Institute</a>, the successful candidate will graduate from the <a href="https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk">School of Engineering</a>. The PhD candidate will also be part of the <a href="http://visualinteractivedata.github.io">Visual+Interactive Data group</a> and <a href="https://www.designinformatics.org">https://www.designinformatics.org</a> and invited to join any group and reading group meetings. We strongly encourage collaborations within the group and our wide network of collaborators. The principal supervisor plans to meet weekly with the PhD candidate to assure close supervision and support.</p>
