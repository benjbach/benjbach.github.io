**Problem:** Dashboards are ubiquitous across many domains including health, energy, governance, business etc. With the recent Covid pandemic, dashboards have found their way into the mainstream media with may news outlets publishing dashboards on public health, climate change, and other public issues. However, there is very little applicable guidance on what makes a dashboard effective and how to design effective dashboards. 

**Approach:** This project investigates ways to evaluate the effectiveness of dashboards as well as proposing means to author dashboards. We will work across a range of domains and applied use cases and will engage in design, prototyping, co-design, and rigorous evaluation methods.

**Skillset:** D3, JavaScript, Tableau, Data Science, Data analysis.
