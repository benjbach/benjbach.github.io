        <h1 id="applying-for-a-phd-at-edinburgh-university">Applying for a PhD at Edinburgh University</h1>

<h2 id="possible-phd-topics"><a href="phd-topics">Possible PhD Topics</a></h2>

<h2 id="phd-in-the-uk">PhD in the UK</h2>
<p>A PhD in the UK is set for 3 years and requires a Master or equivalent. This system is similar to the German and French one, but slightly different from the US and Canadian one. A PhD in the UK is research-only with no need to take classes. Research proposals and 1st supervisor are required at the time of application. If you wish, you can get extra pay for getting involved in teaching as a teaching assistant.
A PhD comes with a salary for 3 years and tuition fees apply, depending on your nationality (see below). You can apply and start a PhD all around the year, though there are stricter deadlines for scholarships (usually between Oct-Feb).
The academic year in the UK is dived into 3 trimesters; Oct-Dec (semester 1), Jan-April (semester 2), May-Sept (summer). There is teaching only in semester 1 + 2. I am supervising master and undergraduate students all around the year.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply-for-a-phd-supervised-by-me">How to apply (for a PhD supervised by me)</h2>
<p>There are several options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/postgraduate/fees/research-scholarships/informatics-global-phd-scholarships">ILCC</a>: You should apply through the School of Informatics and the Institute for Language, Cognition, and Computation (ILCC), which I am part of., Dec 8, again under ILCC.</li>
  <li><a href="http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk">Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence</a></li>
  <li><a href="mailto:bbach@ed.ac.uk">contact me</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can set the starting date as you wish. There are little contrails from my side. However, there are notification deadlines for the tuition funding.</p>

<h2 id="tuition-fees-and-scholarships">Tuition fees and scholarships</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you are UK/EU citizen, you are not required to pay any tuition fees.</li>
  <li>If you are not UK/EU citizen, we need to cover your tuition fee through a scholarship. Usually, to apply for a scholarship you need the unconditional offer from the University (which will pay your salary). Hence, once you know if you will be granted a scholarship, you can still decide whether to take the post or not. From what I have seen, this sort of happens in spring. Hence, unless you have your own scholarship for covering your tuition (e.g. from the US or your home country, etc..) you want to put a starting date later than Spring.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="phd-funding-opportunities">PhD Funding Opportunities</h1>

<p>There are three types of scholarships. Those who cover your salary,  those who cover your tuition, if you are not an EU/UK citizen, and those covering both (if you are an EU/UK citizen, you don’t pay any tuition, thanks to the Scottish Government). There is a range of options for either and I encourage you to check your own sources. The list below certainly is incomplete.</p>
