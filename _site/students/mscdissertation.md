# How To (survive a) Design Informatics MSc Dissertation (in data visualization)

As well as this page, you should read the [Masters Project Guide (Design Informatics)](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mdi/guide.html) on the School of Informatics website.

## What is the purpose of an MSc thesis?

The idea of an MSc thesis is to show that you are capable of individual intellectual work. It should be an original piece of work, addressing an specific problem and discussing solutions or lessons learnt in deadling with this problem. A thesis can range from more practical work to more theoretical and data collection work (more on possible contributions [here](project-planning)).

A thesis wants to assess 

- Can you think and deal with chaos? 
- Can you define a problem? 
- Can you plan and use reserach methods? 
- Can you present results clearly? 
- Can you be creative and critical about methods and solutions?
- Can you reflect and discuss your work? 
- Do you know the context of your work well enough?


## Who "owns" a Dissertation? 

You. You are the sole author and everything you write should be your own thougths and ideas. Your supervisor will help you and can propose you problems and solutions but there are no specific checkboxes or to-do lists prepared for you.

## Components of a Dissertation

A Design Informatics MSc thesis consists of largely 4 components that you should cover in your write-up.
- a **problem**: a problem you describe that requires solution. Ideally, this a hard problem but it must be described and credible. 
- a **solution**: an idea for a tool, a design, a system, survey, etc. that aims to address the problem.
- a **concept/idea**: a concept that is the basis for your solution (e.g., a novel approach or some creative thinking). This is the core of your creative thinking. 
- an **evaluation**: some data / evidence how this solution is helping with your problem.

## Project planning

An MSc dissertation is usually between 3-4 months. This is very short. Below is a possible outline how you should place your milestones. 
- **Month 1 (Exploraton & Scoping):** 
  * [ ] _literature review:_ search for papers, textbooks, websites. Read. Read. Read. Ask your supervisor for seed papers to start from
  * [ ] _formulate your problem._ Discuss with your supervisor
  * [ ] _understand your problem_ (i.e., gather evidence so you are confident about the problem. Your supervisor will help)
  * [ ] do some _initial designs, exploration, ideation_ to figure out which solutions to pursue. Discuss with your supervisor
- **Month 2 (Design & Implememtation):**
  * [ ] _Set on 1-2 possible solutions_ to pursue and implement, i.e., realize, craft, deploy, etc.
  * [ ] _Iterate_ over these solutions. 
  * [ ] _discuss_ with your peers, 
  * [ ] _explore alternatives_ and justify your decisions
  * [ ] _collect ideas for a possible evaluation_ 
  * [ ] ask for _[ethics approval](ethics)_ by the School of Informatics. Talk to your supervisor for help. 
- **Month 3 (Evaluation & Iteration):**
  * [ ] _plan and conduct evaluation_. Ask your supervisor for help and resources (e.g., rooms, materials)
  * [ ] _collect data about evaluation_ 
  * [ ] _analyze data_
  * [ ] possibly _improve prototype_ during evaluation.
- **Month 4 (Discussion & Writing-up):** 
  * [ ] _polish prototype_ based on evaluation results. Prioritize those issues most pressing for your contribution
  * [ ] _discuss your research_: reflect on the results, discuss limitations, 
  * [ ] _write up your thesis_.

See general information on how to plan a project and contribution [here](project-planning).

## Writing up

You are well familar with your project, and ideally your supervisor is, too. However, All that the (other) grader of your thesis will see is your writing. 

Hence, 
- _explain terminology_ you use. More explanation does not hurt. 
- _create meaningful figure captions_ that explain what these figures show. 
- _explain figure content_ in the text and its caption 
- _demonstrate your design and prototype_ through figures and examples. Text is often not enough. 
- _add a URL_ (video, website) to demonstrate your design. This helps enormously
- _explain_ **your** research, not other people's work: around 70% of the writing should focus on your work and your thinking, not describing well known concepts and background. Most of the related and conceptual work should go into into introduction, related work, and discussion.

You need to describe each of these in your thesis. More information on technical writing [here](technical-writing.md).

## What is a 'good dissertation'? 

- A **good thesis (A3)**, contains all four concepts mentioned above and is easy to follow, clear to understand and clearly demonstrate intellectual engagement and knowledge.
- A **very good thesis (A2)** shows creativity beyond a standard approach to solve and evaluate the problem. It has a good question that can have some significance beyond this thesis and the specific problem you look at. It also shows that you can think creatively, explore solutions, and come up with a solid solution yourself. There is some chance this could be included into a publication / furthered into a publication.
- An **outstanding thesis (A1)** provides some novel results, creative thinking, and rigorous and critical engagement with the topic. The thesis presents a novel concept worth publishing and of relevance to other researchers far beyond the School and your supervisor. 

A dissertation grade gets (significantly) lowered for the following reasons:
- writing is unclear and the four componets are not well explained
- figures are unclear and don't show the design/prototype/results. 
- work is not critically discussed and reflected upon 
- the main findings / lessons learned are not well summarized and communicated in the thesis. 
- the writing is bad so that we cannot understand your thoughts
- too little of your work is shown and demonstrated

Also, check the below marking scheme for self-assessement.

## Marking Scheme

Dissertations are marked against the following scheme:
(_unsatisfying, poor, fair, good, very good_)

- Understanding of problem
- Completion of project
- Quality of work
- Quality of dissertation
- Knowedge of literature
- Critical evaluation of previous work
- Critical eval of own work
- Justification of chioces and decisions
- Solution of any conceptual problem
- Amount of work
- Quality of prototype
